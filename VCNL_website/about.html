				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p>After more than five years of designing, implementing, and testing GENI has turned into a lively ecosystem that supports research of future internet systems and technologies. Researchers from the computer networking and distributed system community have created an amazing set of testbeds and tools that serve the community in creating the next-generation Internet. While these ecosystems clearly support the community of experts in computer networking attention must also be given to sustain the GENI research community and its systems. This can only be achieved by attracting new talent to this community. We strongly believe that one way to achieve such sustainability is to attract and educate undergraduate students in computer networking. While virtually all Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering Departments in the US offer an undergraduate class in Computer Networking, we believe that a radical change in how this subject is taught is required to educate the next generation of computer network engineers and scientists. Traditionally these classes are taught in standard lecture style to educate students on the basic concepts of computer networks. To deepen the students knowledge such courses often include programming assignment and labs that analyze the behavior of network protocols. While we strongly believe that is essential to teach students the basic concepts, we see a need to communicate this knowledge in an approach that allows students to learn about new networking technologies in a more ”hands on” style through real virtual labs.<br>Many of the assignments you will find here are implemented using LabWiki. 
LabWiki is a workspace for experimenters. It allows them to plan, prepare and execute experiments and other activities related to experimental based research. LabWiki was developed as a front-end for the Orbit Measurement Framework (OMF). For the last couple of years, NICTA and Winlab have been co-developing OMF for networking testbeds.
