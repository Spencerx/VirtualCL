# Rspec Generator

This is a web tool which can be used for dynamic Rspec generation. It generates two URL, one containing the Rspec and the other containing the oedl script. It generates Rspec for star topology. However, it can be modified to create Rspec for any type of topology. This tool can be used for server-client assignments in networking class. The students just have to choose the number of servers, number of clients and upload the files that are intended to be present inside the server and client nodes. This tool can be used to scale the number of servers and clients. The tool will create a unique URL containing the Rspec which can be used to reserve resources on Geni. When the resources are up and running, the user can find the uploaded files on the respective nodes. The tool will also create a unique URL containing the oedl script which can be used to verify if the resources reserved using the Rspec are up and running. This file should be run on LabWiki. The tool can also be modified to produce oedl scripts for other purposes.
